Hi, I'm looking to outsource the design of an in-house project and wondered if you would be available to put a couple of logo and website concepts together?

Also do you have any experience of admin UI design?

Thanks and hopefully hear from you soon.


Hey Adam,

Thanks for getting in touch.

Sounds cool, what sort of project is it? 

Would the website concepts need to be photoshop, coded or both? I also have experience with UI work, especially admin panels :)

What sort of budget are you set on?

Cheers.
